Instruction (Please remove this instruction after you carefully read)

- Please read the [tutorial guide](https://optuna.github.io/optunahub-registry/recipes/001_first.html) to register your feature in OptunaHub. You can find more detailed explanation of the following contents in the tutorial.
- Looking at [other packages' implementations](https://github.com/optuna/optunahub-registry/tree/main/package) would also be helpful.
- **Please do not use HTML tags in the `README.md` file. Only markdown is allowed. For security reasons, the HTML tags will be removed when the package is registered on the web page.**

## Abstract

You can provide an abstract for your package here.
This section will help attract potential users to your package.

**Example**

This package provides a sampler based on Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization. The sampler is highly sample-efficient, so it is suitable for computationally expensive optimization problems with a limited evaluation budget, such as hyperparameter optimization of machine learning algorithms.

## APIs

Please provide API documentation describing how to use your package's functionalities.
The documentation format is arbitrary, but at least the important class/function names that you implemented should be listed here.
More users will take advantage of your package by providing detailed and helpful documentation.

**Example**

- `MoCmaSampler(*, search_space: dict[str, BaseDistribution] | None = None, popsize: int | None = None, seed: int | None = None)`
  - `search_space`: A dictionary containing the search space that defines the parameter space. The keys are the parameter names and the values are [the parameter's distribution](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/distributions.html). If the search space is not provided, the sampler will infer the search space dynamically.
    Example:
    ```python
    search_space = {
        "x": optuna.distributions.FloatDistribution(-5, 5),
        "y": optuna.distributions.FloatDistribution(-5, 5),
    }
    MoCmaSampler(search_space=search_space)
    ```
  - `popsize`: Population size of the CMA-ES algorithm. If not provided, the population size will be set based on the search space dimensionality. If you have a sufficient evaluation budget, it is recommended to increase the popsize.
  - `seed`: Seed for random number generator.

Note that because of the limitation of the algorithm, only non-conditional numerical parameters can be sampled by the MO-CMA-ES algorithm, and categorical and conditional parameters are handled by random search.

## Installation

If you have additional dependencies, please fill in the installation guide here.
If no additional dependencies is required, **this section can be removed**.

**Example**

```shell
$ pip install scipy torch
```

If your package has `requirements.txt`, it will be automatically uploaded to the OptunaHub, and the package dependencies will be available to install as follows.

```shell
 pip install -r https://hub.optuna.org/{category}/{your_package_name}/requirements.txt
```

## Example

Please fill in the code snippet to use the implemented feature here.

**Example**

```python
import optuna
import optunahub


def objective(trial):
  x = trial.suggest_float("x", -5, 5)
  return x**2


sampler = optunahub.load_module(package="samplers/gp").GPSampler()
study = optuna.create_study(sampler=sampler)
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)
```

## Others

Please fill in any other information if you have here by adding child sections (###).
If there is no additional information, **this section can be removed**.

<!--
For example, you can add sections to introduce a corresponding paper.
