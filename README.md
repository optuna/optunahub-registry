OptunaHub Registry is a registry service for sharing and discovering user-defined Optuna packages. It provides a platform for users to share their Optuna packages with others and discover useful packages created by other users.

See the [OptunaHub Website](https://hub.optuna.org/) for registered packages.

See also the [OptunaHub API documentation](https://optuna.github.io/optunahub/) for the API to use the registry, and the [tutorials](https://optuna.github.io/optunahub/tutorials_for_contributors.html) for how to register and discover packages.
